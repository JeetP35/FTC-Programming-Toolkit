Controller Code List:
    **Note: The y-axis of the sticks is inverted â€” meaning the positive y-axis is treated as negative and the negative y-axis is treated as positive. This can be corrected by multiplying the gamepad variable by -1.**

    first game control = gamepad1
    second game control = gamepad2

    left stick y-axis = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.left_stick_y
    left stick x-axis = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.left_stick_x
    right stick y-axis = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.right_stick_y
    right stick x-axis = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.right_stick_x

    left trigger = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.left_trigger
    right trigger = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.right_trigger
    left bumper = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.left_bumper
    right bumper = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.right_bumper

    a button = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.a
    b button = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.b
    x button = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.x
    y button = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.y

    dpad up = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.dpad_up
    dpad down = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.dpad_down
    dpad left = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.dpad_left
    dpad right = gamepad{**number of the gamepad**}.dpad_right
